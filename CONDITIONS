QUESTION-1
You went on a tour to Ooty with your friends. As a part of the tour, you went boating with them. For the boat to remain stable, the number of people on one boat is restricted based on the weight of the people. You find that the boatman who is sailing your boat is so much greedy of money. For earning more, he takes too many people to travel in the boat at a time. So you want to check how many people can travel in the boat at a time so that the boat will not drown. Calculate the weight by considering the number of adults and number of children. Assume that an adult weighs 75 kg and children weigh 30 kg each. If the weight is normal, display Boat is stable, else display Boat will drown.

ANSWER-1
int main() {
    int w,a,c,sum;
    scanf("%d %d %d",&w,&a,&c);
    sum=((a*75)+(c*30));
    if(sum<=w){
        printf("Boat is stable");
    }
    else{
        printf("Boat will drown");
    }
  
    return 0;
}

QUESTION-9
Mr.Kumar went to purchase stationary items for his office. He asked the shopkeeper for a discount. The shopkeeper said that if he purchases more than 200 quantity of the item, then a discount of 20% can be applied on the total bill amount, excluding the GST. Get the Quantity and price per item as an input and calculate and tell whether Mr.Kumar is eligible for the discount and what would be the net amount he has to pay after the discount. Take the GST at 18%. Net Amount = Total bill amount after discount + GST

QUESTION-10
Electricity board has decided to charge rupees based on the units consumed by a particular home. If the units consumed is less than or equal to 200, the cost for one unit is 0.5. If the unit is less than or equal to 400, the cost for one unit is 0.65 and Rs.100 extra charge. If the unit is less than or equal to 600, the cost for one unit is 0.80 and Rs.200 extra charge. If the unit is greater than 600 the cost for one unit is 1.25 and Rs.425 extra charge. You need to now calculate the electricity bill based on the units consumed (given input).

ANSWER-10
int main() {
    int u;
    scanf("%d",&u);
    if(u<=200){
        printf("Rs.%.0f",u*0.5);
    }
   else if(u<=400){
        printf("Rs.%.0f",((u*0.65)+100));
    }
    else if(u<=600){
        printf("Rs.%.0f",((u*0.80)+200));
    }
     else{
        printf("Rs.%.0f",((u*1.25)+425));
    }
