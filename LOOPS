QUESTION-8
A supermarket maintains a pricing format for all its products. A value N is printed on each product. When the scanner reads the value N on the item, the product of all the digits in the value N is the price of the item. The task here is to design the software such that given the code of any item N the product (multiplication) of all the digits of value should be computed(price).

QUESTION-9
The Torres county visa center generates the token number for its applicants from their application ID. The application ID is a numeric value. The token number generated in a specific form. The even digits in the applicant’s ID are replaced by the digit one greater then the even digit and the odd digits in the applicant’s ID are replaced by the digit one less than the odd digit. The numeric value thus generated represents the taken number of the applicant.

QUESTION-10
The cosmetic company “BeautifyMe” has decided to reward its brand promoters with a batch of cosmetics. Each batch is identified by a unique numeric barcode. Each digit of the barcode number represents a product ID of the products present in the batch. Before distributing the products to its promoters, the company wants to make sure that all products present in the batch are still fresh and safe to use. The distribution center has therefore been advised to identify the oldest product in each batch is the one with the smallest product ID. There can be multiplies of the same product in one batch.

QUESTION-11
An e-commerce website wishes to find the lucky customer who will be eligible for full value cash back. For this purpose, a number N is fed to the system. It will return another number that is calculated by an algorithm. In the algorithm, a sequence is generated, in which each number is the sum of the two proceeding numbers. Initially the sequence will have two 1’s in it. The system will return the Nth number from the generated sequence which is treated as the order ID. The lucky customer will be the one who has placed that order. Write an algorithm to help the website find the lucky customer.

ANSWER-11
int main() {
    int i,n,t1,t2,nextTerm;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    t1=1;t2=1;
  nextTerm=t1+t2;
  for(i=3;i<=n;++i) {
    t1=t2;
    t2=nextTerm;
    nextTerm=t1+t2;
  }
printf("%d",t2);
       return 0;
}
